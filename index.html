Of these the one but the first and <del class="removed" title="I can't agree with Stein since I love using question marks especially when I spam it in confusion like ???">the most the completely most uninteresting is the question mark.</del> The question mark is alright when it is all alone when it is used as a brand on cattle or when it could be used in decoration <del class="removed" title="no! >:( Here's a new example, the question mark ping in League of Legends is very fun to use when you're trying to laugh or annoy a teammate...">but connected with writing it is completely entirely completely uninteresting.</del> It is evident that is you ask a question you ask a question but anybody who can read at all knows when a question is a question as it is written in writing. Therefore I ask you therefore <del class="removed" title="You can purely use it because of grammar!">wherefore should one use the question mark.</del> Beside it does not in its form go with ordinary printing and so <del class="removed" title="I like the form, it's the only curved 'curved' punctuation~">it pleases neither the eye nor the ear</del> and it is therefore like a noun, just an unnecessary name of something. A question is a question, anybody can know that a question is a question and <del class="removed" title="Just because it's fun to use & what if the writing is old english...I can't even understand it not to say know if a question is written...">so why add to it the question mark when it is already there when the question is already there in the writing.</del> Therefore I never could bring myself to use a question mark, I always found it positively revolting, <del class="removed" title="I'm sure a lot of people use question marks on a daily bases!!!">and now very few do use it.</del></p>

                        possession. Well feel as you like about that, I can see and I do see that for many that for some
                        the possessive case apostrophe has a gentle tender insinuation that makes it very difficult to
                        definitely decide to do without it. One does do without it, I do, I mostly always do, but I
                        cannot deny that from time to time I feel myself having regrets and from time to time I put it
                        in to make the possessive case. I absolutely do not like it and leaving it out I feel no regret,
                        there it is unnecessary and not ornamental but inside a word and its s well perhaps, perhaps it
                        does appeal by its weakness to your weakness. At least at any rate from time to time I do find
                        myself letting it alone if it has come in and sometimes it has come in. I cannot positively deny
                        but that I do from time to time let it come in.

                        recently I have felt that one could need them more than one had ever needed them.

                        There are two different way of thinking about colons and semicolons you can think of them as
                        commas and as such they are purely servile or you can think of them as periods and then using
                        them can make you feel adventurous I can see that one might feel about them as periods but I
                        myself never have, I began unfortunately to feel them as a comma and commas are servile they
                        have no life of their own they are dependent upon use and convenience and they are put there
                        just for practical purposes.

                        and definitely I have never used them. I think however lively they are or
                        disguised they are they are definitely more comma than period and so really I cannot regret not
                        having used them. They are more powerful more imposing more pretentious than a comma but they
                        are a comma all the same. They really have within them deeply within them fundamentally within
                        them the comma nature.

                        As I say commas are <span class="ink">servile</span> and they have <span class="ink">no life of their own, and their use is not a use, it is a way of replacing one’s own interest</span> and I do decidedly like to like my own interest my own interest in what I am doing. A comma by helping you along holding your coat for you and putting on your shoes <span class="ink">keeps you from living your life as actively as you should lead it</span> and to me for many years and I still do feel that way about it only now I do not pay as much attention to them, <span class="ink">the use of them was positively degrading.</span>
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        When it gets really difficult you want to disentangle rather than to cut the knot, at least of anybody feels who is working with any thread, so anybody feels who is working with any tool so anybody feels who is writing any sentence or reading it after it has been written. And what does a comma do, <span class="ink">a comma does nothing but make easy a thing that if you like it enough is easy enough without the comma.</span> A long complicated sentence should force itself upon you, make you know yourself knowing it and the comma, <span class="ink">well at the most a comma is a poor period that lets you stop and take a breath</span> but if you want to take a breath you ought to know yourself that you want to take a breath. It is not like stopping altogether has something to do with going on, but taking a breath well you are always taking a breath and why emphasize one breath rather than another breath. Anyway that is the way I felt about it and I felt that about it very very strongly. And so I almost never used a comma. The longer, the more complicated the sentence the greater the number of the same kinds of words I had following one after another, the more the very more I had of them the more <span class="ink">I felt the passionate need of their taking care of themselves by themselves and not helping them, and thereby enfeebling them by putting in a comma.</span>
